# Mark's Musings

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
    - I built this web application to show off some of my HTML and CSS skills. I'm particularly proud of the cool "mood ring" effect that gets applied to many of the elements. I tried to use it sparingly enough!
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
    - This was supposed to be a showcase of our knowledge at this point in the course. I have built applications before, but having someone work through an actual design process and showing how CSS is supposed to be used has helped immensely.
- What problem does it solve?
    - I currently did not have a portfolio, so having this will allow me to provide at least one work example to others.
- What did you learn?
    - I did not know about semantic elements, or have much concern for accessibility. However, after these lessons I feel much more confident in my ability to deploy a website from scratch, and not require boilerplate code from someone else.

## Grading Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
✅ THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
✅ THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
✅ THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
✅ THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
✅ THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
